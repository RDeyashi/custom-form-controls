This is an example of a custom form control.
Generally when we required a form, we design it from scractch, but it tooks more time and if there is any changes in the iniput field then all the design we need to change it.


This is a solutions for that, we can create a custom form control.

Process.

1. I have created a new component 'custom-input', where I have designed the input field, with all the required thing.
2. We developed it using ControlValueAccessor (https://angular.io/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor), this help us to perform all the required operation with a form control.
3. You can download the projects and can demonstrate it.
4. Clone the code base
5. Then install the dependency with 'npm install'
6. Then run the project with 'ng serve'


Thanks for using it.
